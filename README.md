i'm basically trying to learn how claude-code and prompt engineering + permissioning around code refactoring agents work.

this is a repo where im trying to build a framework around that

my reference are claude code, gemini cli, and both the vercel and openai typescript sdks.

if anyone would like to improve the prompts, add more hooks, add frameworks, etc, please feel free to.


## whats done so far

- tool frameworks
- prompting framework (with tool call use )
- injection framework
- sqlite persistence


## todo

- full alerting/notification framework
- tool response context padding
- permissions framework
